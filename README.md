# caterpillar
Foundry module for creating looong monsters (or even players?) . Set up your head, body and rear token, and they will follow each other when you move its head.

Create your "head" actor, edit its prototype token and select "catepillar->Enable", and set a length.
Over at the appearance tab, select images for the body and rear tokens. 
Drag your actor onto the scene, and it will automatically generate all the tail tokens.
