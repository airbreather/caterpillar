# caterpillar
Foundry module for creating snakes, looong monsters,(or even players?) . Modify a token, drag it onto the canvas and it automatically creates a head and many body segments. Move its head and the body follows.

Create your "head" actor, edit its prototype token #1 and enable “caterpillar”, and set a length (in number of segments) #2.
Change over to the appearance tab (#3), and select images for the body and rear tokens (#4). 

Drag your actor onto the scene, and it will automatically generate all the tail tokens.
